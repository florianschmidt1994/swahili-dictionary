# swahili-dictionary
A very simple swahili dictionary with a clean UI

# Build and run
This is a Django application. Run it as you would any other django app.
For this to work the database file (db.sqlite3) needs to be added to 
the root directory, but is omitted from this repository because the license of the translations is not clear.
